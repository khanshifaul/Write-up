## DESCRIPTION
After struggling to secure our secret strings for a long time, we finally figured out the solution to our problem: Make decompilation harder. It should now be impossible to figure out how our programs work!

```bash
$ ./behindthescenes
  ./challenge <password>
```
Now let's open the PE file in Ghidra & Search for "password" in String references. We found the flags:


> HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}
